							<p>
                             Technology can be defined as a practical solution of applying scientific knowledge in carrying out everyday activities effectively and
                             efficiently. Technology today, has taken a path for the better. The advancements seen in this branch of knowledge has to be of the 
                             greatest leaps throughout our time as researchers and developers. We as humans tend to use this development of technology in our 
                             everyday life because its use has made our lives seemingly easier. Be it heating up our food, to washing our cars, to looking up at
                             the news, or even, to submitting our assignments, everything has been made easier for us. With the click of a button or two, we are
                             able to do almost everything we desire without even having to get off of the bed or the living room couch. But with all this use of 
                             technology we need to question ourselves every once in a while, are we really getting the quality of life that we desire or are we becoming slaves to a different form of a ruler? Has technology and its use gone too far for our own good? Have we simply become house bound and lazy?
                             All of these are the concerns of many nowadays, trying to find out whether technology is to blame for or it is us and our unmotivated everyday choices.
							</p>
							<p>
                             Of course we know that the use of technology has its own advantages. That is why we tend to opt to solutions provided by this advanced study
                             for continuing with our lives. With the growth in technology weâ€™ve seen some major reforms in every sector of development. 
                             It can also be said that development of a country can be directly related to the use and advancement of technology of that place.
                             Some of the basic reasons as to why technology has been so important for us is because of its advantages. These are what makes us so reliable on technology. 
                             For instance, it makes any work we do fast & efficient. This is especially needed in a work environment where there is higher demand of such works. 
                             Another factor is the improved communication amongst people. A great example would be the use of messenger in our everyday lives because of how efficient it is.
                             It helps improve our everyday communication and helps us socialize. With this, there is also the development and growth in different sectors like medicine, education, finance, agriculture and many more.
                             All these directly impact our lives and help us attain better quality of life.  The list is endless as the positives of technology are also not limited to a certain field. 
                             This is why it is seen to be greatly influencing our everyday choices and our everyday activities so immensely. 
							</p>
							<p>
                            Despite stating all the obvious advantages to the use of technology and its application in our everyday life, we cannot hide from the fact that there are many
                             disadvantages that have brought upon many discomforts with the growing use of technology. The most evident negative would be todays people spending a majority 
                             of their time on their phones and losing their contact with the people around them. Even though they are connected digitally to the many people on the internet,
                              they are not seen present physically amongst their families. The list continues as we know that this growing use of technology has made us all very lazy. 
                              Not wanting to work, not wanting to move and not wanting to socialize. With these, there are greater problems existing like the building and exporting of 
                              hazardous weapons, companies disregarding smoke from factories in case of mass production, less valuation of human work and higher priority to robotic works. 
                            It is our move, the choices that we make greatly affect the result of technology in our lives.    
                        	</p>
                       		<p>
                            In conclusion, technology cannot be termed good or evil. It is in our hands to make it a balance in our lives because technology can be used for our 
                            benefit as well as our downfall. So, we must be more thoughtful into making positive choices that not only benefit us at the current moment but also 
                            will be able to help us for a substantially longer period of time.
